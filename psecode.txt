the getter and setter are basically made to get and set the values esier the to string methot is to string the hole thing we are doing and the methoths and equal is to compare the methot and see if they are equal or not 

Person:
we do a two abstract methot incrise salary that is going to incrise the salary 
and increse the work hour that is going to increase the hours worked 
subclases:
teacher:
incrise salaray= this methot will incrise the salary depending on how much hours u work first we will ask the user how many hours he works and 
if you work more than 8 hours the the salray will incrise by 5% else nothing happens 

increse hour work=this methot will increse the hour you work in case you work less than a 
x hours ,soo it will do if work less than 3hours incrisee +1 else nothing 

and the computerpayroll=For each full-time teacher, the salary is computed as (32 * degreeRate * 2) * 0.85, where
degreeRate is 112, 82, 42 for PhD, Master, and Bachelor, respectively.
 For each part-time teacher, the salary is computed as (hoursWorked * degreeRate *2) *
0.76, where degreeRate is 112, 82, 42 for PhD, Master, and Bachelor, respectively.
 For each staff, the salary is computed as (workload * 32 * 2) * 0.75, where workload is
the weekly working hours. The working hours cannot exceed 40.

this methot are the same for staff 
then the subclases of teacher part time and full time 

countHourWork= this methot we count the hour that he work too see how many 
hours she works 
this methot is algo going to be implemented in part time
